# DermaScan Web App

This Web Application is the implementation of the Segmentation Model designed in _Ormeño Salazar, V. M., & Sandoval Díaz, J. J. (2025). Segmentación de características morfológicas faciales usando redes neuronales convolucionales: Enfoque en arrugas y manchas [Tesis de bachiller, Universidad ESAN]._
This repository contains the source code for the backend and frontend of the implementation. However, due to authorization reasons, the model is kept out of the repository.
The segmentation model is accesible through contact with the authors of the thesis. We -the developers- do not hold any property over the trained model presented in the thesis previously referenced.

To run, first install the requirements, including flask library as the framework. Then, excecute main.py.
